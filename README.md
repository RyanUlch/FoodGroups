:exclamation:Please Note:  
This is an old project created while learning React and Node.js. It is not regularly maintained anymore. 

## Food-Groups

This project was created using 3rd party libraries
including React, Express, Node.js, Argon2, etc.

Everything else within this app is created by Ryan Ulch, or used with permission. This app does have user curated data and images, I make no claim that the images and information uploaded by independent users is not owned by a 3rd party.

I am not a legal expert, nor do I have extensive knowledge in deployed applications. All of the code was written and distributed as a portfolio piece of my work.

## Security

I make no claim to the security level of the site and it's database information. I have used Argon2 to hash/salt user and group passwords, express/Node to help prevent SQL-injections and XSS attacks, however I do not have professional training in web security at the time of writting this. Users of this website should be aware and (as always) not use the same password as other sites.

## Developer Notes

If you are a potential employer doing their due dilligence in examining my portfolio, please take note:

- This project was created originally as a training exersize devised by myself in order to practice building React Applications. However, as it went on this project exemplified my abilities in handling larger projects. It is not perfect, and could have features added to it (and may in the future). Please take this into consideration while judging the overall quality of the site.

- I don't share practice/course work/personal projects on Github publically. A lack of contributions on my profile is due to this. I have been learning programming starting with C++ since around 2014, and have created applications used by a previous employer in the past (The company owns the rights to that code and I cannot share it publically).
